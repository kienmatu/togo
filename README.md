### Interesting facts about Manabie

- Monthly there are about 2 million lines of code changes (inserted/updated/deleted) committed into our GitHub repositories. To avoid **regression bugs**, we write different kinds of **automated tests** (unit/integration (functionality)/end2end) as parts of the definition of done of our assigned tasks.
- We nurture the cultural values: **knowledge sharing** and **good communication**, therefore good written documents and readable, organizable, and maintainable code are in our blood when we build any features to grow our products.
- We have **collaborative** culture at Manabie. Feel free to ask trieu@manabie.com any questions. We are very happy to answer all of them.

Thank you for spending time to read and attempt our take-home assessment. We are looking forward to your submission.
